# Expense-Tracker
simple java program to learn java making a simple expense tracker

# Overview

This is a simple expense tracker used to keep track of what you spent and where you spent your money. 
This is a command line project to help facilitate my learning of the Java language. 

When running the program it prompts 3 things. Add and expense, display expenses and quit

# Development Environment

I used Microsofts Visual Studio Code

# Future Work

- there is currently a bug with the scanner reading the string when asking for the place
- It would be fun to learn how to make this a user friendly app using a GUI
- When Quiting the program it needs to have a function to save expenese to the file as well as reading when starting.
